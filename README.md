**CyberVest** is an innovative platform designed to bridge the gap between employees' readiness to counter cyberattacks and the evolving threats faced by organizations. With employees often being the biggest vulnerabilities within a company, CyberVest provides a gamified approach to cybersecurity training and assessment to promote engagement and practical learning.

## Vision and Origin

CyberVest was conceptualized and initiated during my time as a **Platform Engineer** at Reece Group. It aims to empower organizations by equipping employees with the tools and knowledge to identify and mitigate cybersecurity threats effectively. The platform emphasizes interactive learning and real-world scenario simulations to enhance cyber-awareness and resilience.
